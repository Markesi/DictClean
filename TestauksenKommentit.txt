Marian comments // 
1. you have very interesting topic for your program
2. it can work with big amount of data!
3. May be need to add READ me file to help to understand more what you program is doing
4. During test this lines have been changed:
Console.Write("\n {0}) {1}{2}", myWordList.Keys.ElementAt(jumper), myWordList.Values.ElementAt(jumper), ";");
\n has been added to improve visualization

string myfilepath = @"C:\Users\k1601808\Source\Repos\MariaShulgina19\DictClean\Data\";
file pach been changed to see file

Good luck!!
